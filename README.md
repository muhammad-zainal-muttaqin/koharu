# Koharu

[Documentation](https://koharu.rs)

ML-powered manga translator, written in **Rust**.

Koharu introduces a new workflow for manga translation, utilizing the power of ML to automate the process. It combines the capabilities of object detection, OCR, inpainting, and LLMs to create a seamless translation experience.

Under the hood, Koharu uses [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) for high-performance inference, and uses [Tauri](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri) for the GUI. All components are written in Rust, ensuring safety and speed.

> [!NOTE]
> Koharu runs its vision models and local LLMs **locally** on your machine by default. If you choose a remote LLM provider, Koharu sends translation text only to the provider you configured. Koharu itself does not collect user data.

- Export to layered PSD with editable text
- Local HTTP API and MCP server for automation

If you just want to get started, see [Install Koharu](https://koharu.rs/how-to/install-koharu/) and [Translate Your First Page](https://koharu.rs/tutorials/translate-your-first-page/).

## Usage

### Hot keys

- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + Mouse Wheel: Zoom in/out
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + Drag: Pan the canvas
- <kbd>Del</kbd>: Delete selected text block

### Export

Koharu can export the current page as a rendered image or as a layered Photoshop PSD. PSD export preserves helper layers and writes translated text as editable text layers, which makes manual cleanup much easier when the automatic pass gets most of the way there.

For export behavior, PSD contents, and file naming, see [Export Pages and Manage Projects](https://koharu.rs/how-to/export-and-manage-projects/).

### MCP Server

Koharu has a built-in MCP server for AI agents. By default it listens on a random port, but you can pin it with the `--port` flag.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
koharu --port 9999
# Windows
koharu.exe --port 9999
```

Then point your client at `http://localhost:9999/mcp`.

For local setup and the available tools, see [Run GUI, Headless, and MCP Modes](https://koharu.rs/how-to/run-gui-headless-and-mcp/), [Configure MCP Clients](https://koharu.rs/how-to/configure-mcp-clients/), and [MCP Tools Reference](https://koharu.rs/reference/mcp-tools/).

### Headless Mode

Koharu can also run without the desktop window.

```bash
# macOS / Linux
koharu --port 4000 --headless
# Windows
koharu.exe --port 4000 --headless
```

You can then open the web UI at `http://localhost:4000`.

For runtime modes, ports, and local endpoints, see [Run GUI, Headless, and MCP Modes](https://koharu.rs/how-to/run-gui-headless-and-mcp/).

## GPU acceleration

Koharu supports CUDA, Metal, and Vulkan for acceleration. CPU fallback is always available if the accelerated path is unavailable or not worth the trouble on your system.

### CUDA (NVIDIA GPUs on Windows)

Koharu is built with CUDA support on Windows so it can use NVIDIA GPUs for the full local pipeline.

Koharu bundles CUDA Toolkit 13.1. The required DLLs are extracted to the application data directory on first run.

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have current NVIDIA drivers installed. You can update them through [NVIDIA App](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/software/nvidia-app/).

#### Supported NVIDIA GPUs

Koharu supports NVIDIA GPUs with compute capability 7.5 or higher.

If you want to confirm GPU support, see [CUDA GPU Compute Capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) and the [cuDNN Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/backend/latest/reference/support-matrix.html).

### Metal (Apple Silicon on macOS)

Koharu supports Metal on Apple Silicon Macs. That gives you local acceleration without any extra setup beyond the normal app install.

### Vulkan (Windows and Linux)

Koharu also supports Vulkan on Windows and Linux. This path is mainly used for OCR and local LLM inference.

Detection and inpainting still depend on CUDA or Metal, so Vulkan is helpful but not a full replacement for the main accelerated path. AMD and Intel GPUs can still benefit from it, but the best all-around experience is still NVIDIA on Windows or Apple Silicon on macOS.

### CPU fallback

You can always force Koharu to use CPU for inference:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
koharu --cpu
# Windows
koharu.exe --cpu
```

For backend selection, fallback behavior, and model runtime support, see [Acceleration and Runtime](https://koharu.rs/explanation/acceleration-and-runtime/).

## ML Models

Koharu uses a mix of computer vision and language models rather than trying to solve the whole page with one model.

### Computer Vision Models

Koharu uses several pre-trained models for different parts of the pipeline:

- [PP-DocLayoutV3](https://huggingface.co/PaddlePaddle/PP-DocLayoutV3_safetensors) for text detection and layout analysis
- [comic-text-detector](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/comic-text-detector) for text segmentation
- [PaddleOCR-VL-1.5](https://huggingface.co/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR-VL-1.5) for OCR text recognition
- [lama-manga](https://huggingface.co/mayocream/lama-manga) for inpainting
- [YuzuMarker.FontDetection](https://huggingface.co/fffonion/yuzumarker-font-detection) for font and color detection

The models are downloaded automatically when you run Koharu for the first time.

We convert the upstream weights to safetensors format for better compatibility and runtime behavior in Rust. The converted weights are hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/mayocream).

For a closer look at the pipeline, see [Models and Providers](https://koharu.rs/explanation/models-and-providers/) and the [Technical Deep Dive](https://koharu.rs/explanation/technical-deep-dive/).

### Large Language Models

Koharu supports both local and remote LLM backends, and it tries to preselect a sensible model based on your system locale when possible.

#### Local LLMs

Koharu supports quantized GGUF models through [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). These models run on your machine and are downloaded on demand when you select them in Settings. Supported models and suggested usage:

For translating to English:

- [vntl-llama3-8b-v2](https://huggingface.co/lmg-anon/vntl-llama3-8b-v2-gguf): around 8.5 GB in Q8_0, best when translation quality matters more than speed or memory use
- [lfm2-350m-enjp-mt](https://huggingface.co/LiquidAI/LFM2-350M-ENJP-MT-GGUF): very small and easy to run on CPUs or low-memory GPUs, good for quick previews and low-spec machines

For translating to Chinese:

- [sakura-galtransl-7b-v3.7](https://huggingface.co/SakuraLLM/Sakura-GalTransl-7B-v3.7): around 6.3 GB, a good balance of quality and speed on 8 GB GPUs
- [sakura-1.5b-qwen2.5-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/shing3232/Sakura-1.5B-Qwen2.5-v1.0-GGUF-IMX): lighter and faster, useful on mid-range GPUs or CPU-only setups

For other languages, you can use:

- [hunyuan-7b-mt-v1.0](https://huggingface.co/Mungert/Hunyuan-MT-7B-GGUF): around 6.3 GB, with decent multilingual translation quality

LLMs are downloaded on demand when you pick a model in Settings. If you are memory-bound, start small. If you have enough VRAM or RAM, the 7B and 8B models usually produce better translations.

#### Remote LLMs

Koharu can also translate through remote or self-hosted API providers instead of a downloaded local model. Supported remote providers:

- OpenAI
- Gemini
- Claude
- DeepSeek
- OpenAI Compatible, including LM Studio, OpenRouter, or any endpoint that exposes the OpenAI-style `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions` APIs

Remote providers are configured in **Settings > API Keys**. OpenAI-compatible providers also need a custom base URL. API keys are optional for local servers such as LM Studio, but usually required for hosted services such as OpenRouter.

Use a remote provider if you do not want to download local models, if you want to keep VRAM and RAM usage down, or if you already have a hosted model endpoint. Keep in mind that the OCR text selected for translation is sent to the provider you configured.

For LM Studio, OpenRouter, and other OpenAI-style endpoints, see [Use OpenAI-Compatible APIs](https://koharu.rs/how-to/use-openai-compatible-api/). For provider configuration, see [Settings Reference](https://koharu.rs/reference/settings/).

## Ubuntu 22.04 Headless CPU

If you want a reproducible Ubuntu 22.04 setup without CUDA and without the desktop window, use the helper script in this repository.

### What this path does

- installs the Linux system packages needed for a source build
- installs Rust and Bun if they are missing
- builds the static UI
- builds the `koharu` binary in CPU-only mode
- predownloads the default runtime and vision dependencies
- serves the browser UI and API in headless mode

### Bootstrap on Ubuntu 22.04

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mayocream/koharu.git
cd koharu
bash scripts/bootstrap-ubuntu22-headless-cpu.sh
```

### Start headless mode

```bash
bash scripts/run-headless-cpu.sh
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4000/
```

Useful endpoints:

- Web UI: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/`
- API: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/api/v1/meta`
- MCP: `http://127.0.0.1:4000/mcp`

### Why this path exists

The default Linux desktop build path in this repository follows the CUDA-enabled feature path. On Ubuntu 22.04 systems where you want a headless CPU-only deployment, the direct `cargo build --release -p koharu --no-default-features` path is more practical.

Headless mode also needs access to the built `ui/out` assets. This repository includes a filesystem asset fallback so the browser UI can be served even when using the CPU-only direct Cargo build instead of the normal Tauri packaging flow.

### xAI OpenAI-compatible setup

Koharu's OpenAI-compatible provider expects:

- base URL ending in `/v1`
- `GET /models`
- `POST /chat/completions`

For xAI, configure **Settings -> Local LLM & OpenAI Compatible Providers** like this:

- `Preset 1` or `Preset 2`
- `Base URL`: `https://api.x.ai/v1`
- `API Key`: your xAI API key
- `Model name`: the exact model `id` returned by `GET /models`

Example:

```bash
curl https://api.x.ai/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY"
```

### Optional systemd service

Copy the provided unit file into place, then enable it:

```bash
cp deploy/koharu-headless-cpu.service /etc/systemd/system/
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now koharu-headless-cpu
```
